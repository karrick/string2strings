# String2Strings

String2Strings is an implementation of a map or dictionary of strings
to slices of strings. The values are lists of strings which may be
sorted or unsorted.

# Sorted and Unsorted lists

When sorted, the data structure will maintain the slice of strings in
lexicographical order. When unsorted, the data structure will maintain
the slice of strings in insertion order.
